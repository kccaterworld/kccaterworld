I'm Kemal (they/them), a high schooler just trying to survive the stress while also teaching myself three different programming languages outside of class.
I'm not great, but I'm working on improving and growing my skillset.
This is my GitHub account, where I have repos for some of my [AI research](https://github.com/kccaterworld/inspiritwork),
[my high school comp sci classes](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kcater70IntroToCS),
and [my own personal website](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kccaterworld.github.io) hosted.

You can also find my [soap store](https://go.caterworld.xyz/sudsysoapstore), which is hosted on GitLab, and was written and is still maintained by me.

Feel free to reach out, I'll respond as quickly as I can. 


## 🔭 Current Major Projects:
I'm working on various types of data representation and visualization, including [hashing, ciphers, and encryption](https://github.com/kccaterworld/encryption).
This project is in collaboration with [my friend, Melody-TG](https://github.com/Melody-TG). The current major programs are
[Caesar](https://github.com/kccaterworld/encryption/tree/main/Caesar) and [Hash](https://github.com/kccaterworld/encryption/tree/main/Hash),
although I plan to work on adding compression algorithms and Vigenère ciphers.

I'm also exploring rendering and game development with [Game of Life](https://github.com/kccaterworld/game-of-life), which is Conway's Game of Life implemented in Python
using a few different rendering methods, including Pygame. The skills I learn from this project will be used for my rendering engine, which is still in the planning stages.
Eventually I want to implement this in Rust as well, although I'm still learning Rust so that's a long way off.

Game of Life is intended to be a stepping stone into more complex rendering, and once I finish that I hope to build a custom 2d and even 3d rendering engine
from scratch. I'm currently working on learning the math behind 3d rendering, and once I have a good grasp of that I will start actually implementing an engine.
