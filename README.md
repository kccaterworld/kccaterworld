## Hi omigosh welcome!

I'm Kemal (they/them), a high schooler just trying to survive the stress while also teaching myself three different programming languages outside of class.
I'm not great, but I'm working on improving and growing my skillset.

This is my GitHub account, where I have repos for some of my [AI research](https://github.com/kccaterworld/inspiritwork),
[my high school comp sci classes](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kcater70IntroToCS),
and [my own personal website](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kccaterworld.github.io) hosted.

You can also find my [soap store](https://go.caterworld.xyz/sudsysoapstore), which is hosted on GitLab, and was written and is still maintained by me.

My username on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/professorkamel/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/users/1137731457167659031) is ProfessorKamel, and my email is kc@caterworld.xyz.

Feel free to reach out, I'll respond as quickly as I can.
