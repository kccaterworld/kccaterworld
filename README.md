I'm Kemal (they/them), a high schooler just trying to survive the stress while also teaching myself three different programming languages outside of class.
I'm not great, but I'm working on improving and growing my skillset.

This is my GitHub account, where I have repos for some of my [AI research](https://github.com/kccaterworld/inspiritwork),
[my high school comp sci classes](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kcater70IntroToCS),
and [my own personal website](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kccaterworld.github.io) hosted.

You can also find my [soap store](https://go.caterworld.xyz/sudsysoapstore), which is hosted on GitLab, and was written and is still maintained by me.

My username on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/professorkamel?igsh=MTJodWRlOHRsdzh2Yw==) and [Discord](https://discord.com/users/1137731457167659031) is ProfessorKamel, and my email is kc@caterworld.xyz.

Feel free to reach out, I'll respond as quickly as I can.

## ðŸ”­ Current Major Projects:
As of June 2025, I will have finished my [Intro to Computer Science Course](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kcater70IntroToCS) and will be starting AP Computer Science in the fall.

I'll make an APCS repository when the time comes, there's no need to make a repository that'll be empty all summer.

I'm always working on [my website](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kccaterworld.github.io), and the grind truly never ends.

That's really it in terms of projects in progress right now, I don't have time for much more.
