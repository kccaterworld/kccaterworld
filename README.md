## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my GitHub account, where I have repos for some of my [AI research](https://github.com/kccaterworld/inspiritwork),
[my high school comp sci classes](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kcater70IntroToCS),
and [my own personal website](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kccaterworld.github.io) hosted.

My username on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/professorkamel/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/users/1137731457167659031) is ProfessorKamel, and my email is kc@caterworld.xyz.

Feel free to reach out, I'll respond as quickly as I can.
