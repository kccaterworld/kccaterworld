I'm Kemal (they/them), a high schooler just trying to survive the stress while also teaching myself three different programming languages outside of class.
I'm not great, but I'm working on improving and growing my skillset.

This is my GitHub account, where I have repos for some of my [AI research](https://github.com/kccaterworld/inspiritwork),
[my high school comp sci classes](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kcater70IntroToCS),
and [my own personal website](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kccaterworld.github.io) hosted.

You can also find my [soap store](https://go.caterworld.xyz/sudsysoapstore), which is hosted on GitLab, and was written and is still maintained by me.

Feel free to reach out, I'll respond as quickly as I can.

## 🔭 Current Major Projects:
I'm working on various types of data representation and visualization, including [hashing, ciphers, and encryption](https://github.com/kccaterworld/encryption). This project is in collaboration with [my friend, Melody-TG](https://github.com/Melody-TG). The current major programs are [Caesar](https://github.com/kccaterworld/encryption/tree/main/Caesar) and [Hash](https://github.com/kccaterworld/encryption/tree/main/Hash), although I plan to work on adding compression algorithms and Vigenère ciphers.

I'm also exploring rendering and game development with [game-of-life](https://github.com/kccaterworld/game-of-life), which is Conway's Game of Life implemented in Python using a few different rendering methods, including Pygame. The skills I learn from this project will be used for my rendering engine, which is still in the planning stages.

I'm always working on [my website](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kccaterworld.github.io), and the grind truly never ends. It now even includes my [blog](https://github.com/kccaterworld/blog)!

## 💻 My various projects on here
### [My Website](https://github.com/kccaterworld/kccaterworld.github.io)

### [encryption](https://github.com/kccaterworld/encryption)

[![encryption badge](https://hackatime-badge.hackclub.com/U0918A4S79V/encryption)](https://github.com/kccaterworld/encryption)

The repository for my encryption repository.

Although it's called encryption, it's largely focused on data representation, and also includes hashing, ciphers, encoding and decoding, and compression.

Collaboration between me and [Melody-TG](https://github.com/Melody-TG), more people are welcome to contribute! Contributing guide can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/kccaterworld/encryption/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) or near the repository README.
